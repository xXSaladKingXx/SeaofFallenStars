  "backstory": "Born in 1330 DR, Azoun Matarys IV was the fourth child of King Kurzon II. When the Spring Sweats claimed nearly all of his close family between 1342–1346, he became king at sixteen (1346 DR), an unlikely warrior-king shaped by loss. He married Syllistine, a common-born woman of three-quarters elven blood, and forced the court to accept her with a public wedding meant to silence legitimacy doubts. His reign is long and hard-won: he beat back Sembian pressures, survived internal civil war, and afterward commissioned new holds to reward wartime backers. In later years, his sweeping ban on hunting and woodcutting in the Kingsforest preserved the wilds but worsened banditry and monster incursions—pushing him to rely heavily on adventurers for frontier defense. In the looming eastern crisis, he is urged by Whispermaster Geralt Redstar to strike against Vael’Sharan secession, while Crown Prince Alric presses to act before the Crown loses initiative; Azoun ultimately calls the banners and orders loyal hosts to muster at Arabel for war.",
